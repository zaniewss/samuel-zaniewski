    <!--Assume you are preparing to graduate from MATC. You are looking to enter the job market. In order to set up an interview you must first provide a resume. You decide what better way to show off your "web" talents than by showing a future employer your online resume. You may wish to visit indeed.com or another online source for tips on building your resume. Note: I am not grading the content itself, therefore, this can be a fictitious resume.-->

    <h1>Sam Zaniewski's Resume Page</h1>

    <h2>Hi! My name is Sam! Nice to meet ya!</h2>

    <p>I've been at MATC for a semester, since I was doing it last semester at WhitnalL high, and I am aiming to get my associates degree in web application and software development by the end of 2023! I have been programming since the 8th grade, starting with my class of learning how to type effeciently! Since then I haven't wanted to take any other class other than programming classes! I'm also a great employee, working two jobs previously at the Stained Glass Studio of Milwaukee, a local glass shop owned by my Grandfather, Ken Stanis, (reach at 414-466-9597) and Burger King on Highway 100 in Hales Corners (number found at burgerking.com) and I've been told countless times I work well as a people person, further proving my potential in the field of programming which almost primarily focuses on team work projects, like in game development companies.</p>
