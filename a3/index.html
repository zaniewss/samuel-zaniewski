        <h3>Stealing is wrong.</h3>
        <p> Stealing from a retail store damages the company’s profits in direct and indirect ways. The immediate loss of product for sale hurts the company’s ability to offer items to consumers willing to buy them, while the costs to replace stolen goods increases production costs. As someone who works in a huge Stained Glass Store in Wauwautosa, (stainedglassmilwaukee.com) I know that people have stolen from us, and it's sad to think that we can't trust our customers that way, because people need to learn that things don't come free to them in this world. Everything comes with hard earned work and it pays off in the end with your reward! There's no need to steal if you can just follow that!</p>

        <div class="rightText">
            <h3 class = "rightText">Instead, do this!</h3>
            <p class = "rightText">As kids, you can go and ask your parents or grandparents if there is anything you can do for some cash to get what you would have instead stole! That way, you don't risk getting caught by the law, and having to pay your fair share of candy bars behind those bars. But for you Adults, go find a local paper and look for a job, so you don't mug someone and end up dragging that mug against the bars instead >:| </p>

            <h3 class='conclusion'>Overall, Don't Steal!</h3>
            <p class='conclusion'>It just isn't worth the cost! Between the cost of the court fees, the charges on you for stealing, the price of the item you stole, the price of breaking your parent's trust, and breaking a perfect clean record that could temper with the potential of getting jobs in your future, the price just isn't worth it!</p>
