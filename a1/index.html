            For the final project of this class I would like to make myself a website containing all of my programs
            and assignments from over the years so that I can use this website as a guide to any future employers
            of mine as a virtual porftolio of my projects! I hope to get all the information I need to be able to 
            make the website look as professional as it can while doing it from scratch! :D
        </p>
