    <p class="goals">My plan for the future is to become somewhat of a game developer. Weather that means the front end work or the back end work, I can do both! I just love what it takes to make up the story and the characters and the team itself its just something I stride to be a part of someday! - Example: The team who works behind Friday Night Funkin, a group of friends who made it for free online open sourced so anyone can do anything with it (until the final release) I mean thats just amazing at a programming standpoint because I was able to take time out and see what it took to make all of that up and I really do want to accomplish it someday!</p>
