    <h2 class="aboutme">Hi! I'm Sam Zaniewski! Learn about me!</h2>
    <p>I grew up in Franklin, WI with my dad, mom, brother jack, and for later changes, losing my birth mom from kidney and liver failure in March of 2020. My parents divorced when I was twelve and I turned to the internet for a way to escape the things going on around me. Thankfully I grew up in a household where tech was never an issue, because my father works for Xerox and we've always just "had to have the best tech for his job", so I was thrilled to have Plants v.s. Zombies to first turn to when issues came about. I was also able to get my little brother Jack distracted from everything wrong happening around him, by having him do the same, and I would protect him from the emotional trauma that I know hurts me, so that it wouldn't have to hurt more than one person. Who knows maybe I set him on the same path someday :D.</p>

    <p>On top of that learning later that I was saved when I was born by machines, I then knew exactly what I had to become
    someday. Thus leading me to the path of my Associates Degree in Web Application and Software Development! After my
    parents divorce, my dad found my current step mother who gave me my amazing little sister Freyja and her little brother
    Odin on the way as of writing this in Nov of 2021.</p>

    <p>Originally I had been at Franklin High School, but I just never felt a connection with any of the teachers there and
    never felt in place there, so I transferred to Whitnall High School in my Junior year and instantly me and the
    programming teacher there connected and got me to join clubs such as the E-Sports club, and the Robotics Club, both very
    fun events. Having those amazing connections was the final big push I truly needed to see myself as a programmer at some
    point.</p>
