    <p>Deliverable:
    
    This assignment spans multiple weeks. It is intended that students will work on it over multiple weeks, adding elements
    learned during this time.
    
    Create a basic 5-page website, on the topic of your choice, that contains the following minimum requirements. Content
    suggestions: a small business, a local restaurant, a new product announcement, etc. In order to more fully practice your
    new web development skills, please select a topic that is different from that of your final project.
    
    Relative links (to link each of your 5 pages together)
    HTML5 code - first (main) page saved as index.html
    Title should be logical and meaningful with 1-2 focus keywords and should especially include the name of the
    organization
    Meta tags with description and keywords (for SEO purposes)
    HTML5 semantic elements for at the least the following header, main, footer, nav, and aside
    Multiple heading tags (only one h1 but multiple h2 and h3 headings) to organize levels of information, formatted using
    CSS with color(s) other than black
    At least three paragraphs of text per page, formatted using CSS with a sans-serif font-family other than the default
    (with three fallback font options)
    Proper use of an imported Google Font
    Content with styled fonts (i.e. italics, bold, text-shadow) to draw attention to certain words
    A fully functional navigation bar linking all five pages together
    CSS styles created in external CSS file, linked to from the HTML file, with a minimum of 15 different styles
    A favicon image of your choice
    CSS3 code - saved in an external main.css file
    Page layout done using CSS
    Formatting done using CSS
    Formatted text (using font/text styles in your external style sheet document)
    Submit by uploading via FTP to your a5 folder on the create.matc.edu web server
    Paste the URL to your assignment in the designated area of the Blackboard site once you have completed the assignment
    You are required to write/edit the code from scratch (evidence of the use of a web authoring software application will
    result in a zero on this assignment)
    You are permitted to use the book's example files to get you started, but be sure to change enough so that I can tell
    you know what you're doing
    The grading emphasis for this assignment is the quality of your HTML and CSS code. Please remember to validate your code
    at https://validator.w3.org/ - and much like the HTML validator, there is also a CSS validator available at:
    https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/. Fixing your errors will improve your coding skills (and your grade!).
    
    To submit, return to Blackboard and copy and paste the URL of your a5 folder (i.e.
    https://create.matc.edu/username/webdev114/a5 using your actual username) in the comments section of Assignment 5 in the
    Submit Assignments section.</p>
